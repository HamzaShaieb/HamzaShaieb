### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! I'm Hamza, a full-stack web developer with 1 years of experience building web applications using a range of technologies and frameworks.

I have a strong passion for solving complex problems and creating elegant, scalable solutions that provide a great user experience. My technical skills include proficiency in both front-end and back-end development, with expertise in a variety of languages, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, and SQL.

As a full-stack developer, I am able to work on all aspects of a project, from the initial concept and planning stages to development, testing, and deployment. I have experience working with a range of databases, including MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL, and am comfortable working with APIs and integrating third-party services.

In addition to my technical skills, I have excellent communication skills and am able to work effectively both independently and as part of a team. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.

Feel free to check out my GitHub profile to see some of my recent projects, or get in touch if you'd like to discuss a potential collaboration or job opportunity. Thanks for stopping by!
